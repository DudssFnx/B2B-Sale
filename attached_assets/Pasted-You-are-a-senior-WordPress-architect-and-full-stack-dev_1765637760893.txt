You are a senior WordPress architect and full-stack developer.

Your task is to build a PRIVATE, CLOSED WordPress website for internal business use only.
This site is NOT public and NOT for resale.

GOAL:
Create a B2B wholesale catalog and order system inspired by Mercos, focused on speed, simplicity, and scalability.

GENERAL RULES:
- The website must be 100% CLOSED (login required to view anything).
- No public pages, no product visibility without login.
- Clean, fast, lightweight structure.
- Must support up to 2,000 registered clients.
- The system is for INTERNAL USE ONLY.

TECH STACK:
- WordPress (latest stable version)
- PHP 8+
- MySQL
- Lightweight theme (custom or minimal starter theme)
- No heavy page builders (avoid Elementor if possible)
- REST API enabled
- Ready for future AI integrations

AUTHENTICATION:
- Custom login page
- Only approved users can register (admin approval required)
- Roles:
  - Admin
  - Sales
  - Customer
- Customers cannot see other customers’ data
- Admin can see everything

CATALOG (LIKE MERCOS):
- Product catalog (no online payment for now)
- Products must have:
  - Name
  - SKU
  - Category
  - Images
  - Price (can be hidden or shown depending on user role)
  - Stock (optional)
- Categories and filters (brand, type, price, availability)

ORDER SYSTEM:
- Customers can:
  - Browse catalog
  - Add products to cart
  - Generate an order (NO PAYMENT)
  - Orders are saved as "Pending"
- Admin/Sales can:
  - View all orders
  - Edit orders
  - Change order status
  - Export orders (CSV / Excel)

ERP INTEGRATION (IMPORTANT):
- Prepare the system to integrate with:
  - Bling ERP
  - Other ERPs in the future
- Use API-first mindset
- Orders and products must be easily syncable via API
- No hard-coded logic

DASHBOARD:
- Customer dashboard:
  - View orders
  - Reorder previous orders
  - Update profile
- Admin dashboard:
  - Manage users
  - Manage products
  - Manage orders
  - View basic reports

PERFORMANCE:
- Fast loading
- Optimized database queries
- Cache-ready
- Secure (nonces, permissions, sanitization)

DESIGN:
- Clean B2B interface
- Simple UI similar to Mercos
- Focus on usability, not fancy animations
- Desktop-first, but responsive

FUTURE READY:
- Structure the code so it can later:
  - Add payments
  - Add AI features
  - Add mobile app
  - Add WhatsApp automation

DELIVERABLE:
- Clear folder structure
- Custom plugins if needed
- Well-commented code
- Instructions on how to install and deploy

Do NOT:
- Do NOT make it public
- Do NOT add marketplace features
- Do NOT add unnecessary plugins
